Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Email Spam
This is a data science project from CodersCave Cave that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an email spam dataset. The aim of this project is to understand the characteristics of spam emails and to determine which features are most useful for classifying emails as spam or not spam.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the spam.csv dataset, which contains a collection of emails labeled as spam or not spam. Each email is represented by two columns: v1, which contains the label (spam or not spam), and v2, which contains the text of the email.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

spam.csv: the dataset used in the project
email_spam_eda.ipynb: a Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code and analysis
README.md: this file
Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
These libraries can be installed using pip or conda.

Running the Project
To run the project, simply open the email_spam_eda.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the code cells. The code will load the spam.csv dataset, perform EDA using various visualization and statistical techniques, and draw conclusions about the characteristics of spam emails.

Conclusion
Exploratory data analysis is an important step in any data science project, as it helps to understand the data and identify patterns and relationships that can inform the modeling process. In this project, we performed EDA on an email spam dataset and gained insights into the features that are most useful for classifying emails as spam or not spam. These insights can be used to develop more accurate and effective spam filters that can help users to better manage their email inboxes.
